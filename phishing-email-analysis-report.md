Phishing Indicators Found
   

Suspicious Sender Email Domain:

The sender's email address support@securebanking.com appears to be from a legitimate banking institution. However, the domain securebanking.com does not match the official domain of the known bank (e.g., bankname.com). This discrepancy raises suspicion.    
Urgent Call to Action:

The subject line states, "Urgent: Your Account Has Been Compromised!" This creates a sense of urgency, prompting immediate action without careful consideration.    
Generic Greeting:

The email starts with "Dear Customer" instead of addressing the recipient by name. Legitimate companies usually personalize their communications.    
Poor Grammar and Spelling:

The email contains awkward phrasing, such as "Please verify your identity immediately." Legitimate companies typically proofread their communications.    
Suspicious Links:

The link provided appears to direct to the bank's website but actually leads to http://securebanking.com/verify. Hovering over the link reveals that it does not direct to the official bank website.    
Request for Personal Information:

The email requests sensitive information, such as account numbers and passwords, which legitimate companies typically do not ask for via email.    
Threat of Account Suspension:

The email threatens account suspension if the recipient does not act quickly, which is a common tactic used in phishing attempts.    
Inconsistent Email Header Information:

Analyzing the email header may reveal that the originating IP address does not match the expected geographic location of the bank's servers.
